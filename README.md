# StarWars Sample Application

This is the implementation of StarWars SDK.

# Getting started

The Sample application demonstrates the tasks that were assigned which are as follows.

- Eye color of 5 different people from the Star Wars franchise.
- Population of 5 different planets that list their population and climate.
- All the films, their title, opening crawl, and the year they were released.

# Implementation

The main page displays the option to select each task.
